🎓 University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC)
Data Science & Statistics Project Portfolio
🧭 Overview

Welcome to my UIUC Data Science & Statistics Portfolio, a curated collection of academic and applied projects completed during my Master’s in Statistics at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign (UIUC).

Each folder contains a self-contained project with its own analysis, code, data, and README.md.
Together, these works showcase my skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, robust regression, spatial analysis, and data engineering — applied across diverse domains including finance, agriculture, housing, and health analytics.

📁 Repository Contents
Folder	Project Title	Description
🏠 CaliforniaHousingProject	Geospatial Analysis of California’s Housing Market	Explores spatial clustering and geographic inequality in California housing prices using spatial autocorrelation (Moran’s I), hot-spot detection, and geographically weighted regression.
🌾 IllinoisAgriDB	Illinois Agricultural Stations Database (CS 411)	Develops a relational SQL database and interactive machine-learning pipeline to predict crop yields using USDA, weather, and soil data. Includes a Flask interface for user-input prediction.
🔗 Independence_Testing_for_Multivariate_Data_Project	Comparative Study of Multivariate Independence Tests (STAT 428)	Implements and compares Distance Correlation, HSIC, and rank-based tests to detect complex dependencies in multivariate data, supported by simulations and real-world applications.
🏋️ MLgym	Robust Regression Analysis with M and P Estimators (STAT 527)	Applies robust regression to gym activity data to study outlier effects on model stability. Compares M-estimator and P-estimator methods for efficiency versus robustness.
💹 Predicting_Banking_Crises_in_Africa	Machine Learning for Financial Stability (STAT 545)	Builds and evaluates ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict banking crises across 13 African countries using macroeconomic indicators.
💰 STAT447FinalProject	Lending Club Loan Risk Prediction	Performs exploratory data analysis, feature selection, and classification modeling (KNN, Logistic, Random Forest) to predict borrower repayment outcomes and manage lending risk.
