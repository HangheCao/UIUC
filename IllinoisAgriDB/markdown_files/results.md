| Index Strategy | Index Definition | Advantages | Disadvantages | Expected Performance |
|----------------|------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Default (No Index) | None | • No storage overhead<br>• No maintenance cost<br>• Good for small tables | • Full table scans required<br>• Expensive JOIN operations<br>• No optimization for WHERE clause | Slowest - must scan all rows in weather and soil tables |
| Weather Station | `CREATE INDEX weather_station ON weather(station(50))` | • Improves JOIN between weather and stations<br>• Better for station-based lookups<br>• Helps with ORDER BY station_name | • Doesn't help with year=2022 filtering<br>• Still requires scanning soil table<br>• Extra storage for index | Medium - improves JOIN but doesn't help with year filter |
| Soil Month | `CREATE INDEX idx_soil_month ON soil(month)` | • Helps with month-based grouping<br>• Small index size (integer column)<br>• Could help with month JOIN condition | • Very low selectivity (only 12 possible values)<br>• Doesn't help with station or year conditions<br>• Limited benefit for complex JOIN | Better than default but still suboptimal due to low selectivity |
