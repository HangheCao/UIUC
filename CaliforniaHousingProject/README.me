🏠 Geospatial Analysis of California’s Housing Market

A Spatial Modeling Approach Using the 1990 U.S. Census Data

📘 Overview

This project investigates the spatial patterns and drivers of housing prices across California using data from the 1990 U.S. Census. By combining geospatial visualization and spatial econometric methods, it explores how geography, demographics, and economic indicators — such as coastal proximity, housing age, and income levels — interact to shape regional disparities in real estate values.

The project provides a comprehensive example of how spatial dependence and heterogeneity influence housing markets and offers insights into California’s longstanding housing affordability challenges

🎯 Objectives

Detect spatial clustering of housing values using Moran’s I to determine whether high or low-value areas are geographically concentrated.

Identify spatial inequities via hotspot/coldspot analysis, highlighting statistically significant clusters of high or low housing values.

Model regional variations in housing drivers using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) to understand how predictors like median income and ocean proximity vary spatially.

Visualize housing value distributions through Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) maps to reveal hidden spatial trends around urban and coastal zones.

dplyr, tidyr	Data manipulation
📊 Data Description

The dataset captures a snapshot of California’s housing market in 1990, a period marking early signals of the state’s modern housing divide.

Coastal regions (e.g., Bay Area, Los Angeles) already exhibited higher median house values due to environmental and economic advantages.

Inland regions (e.g., Central Valley, inland deserts) tended to have lower income and house values, reflecting emerging affordability gaps.

Spatial heterogeneity — variation in relationships across regions — is a key finding, indicating that housing price drivers differ spatially and cannot be explained by a single global model.

📈 Key Findings

Strong Spatial Clustering:
Moran’s I confirmed statistically significant clustering of housing values — high-value neighborhoods are geographically close to one another, forming clear coastal “hot zones.”

Regional Inequity Patterns:
Hotspot analysis revealed high-value concentrations along the Pacific Coast, particularly near San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego, while coldspots dominate inland and rural areas.

Spatial Non-Stationarity:
GWR results showed that the impact of median income on house value varies — it’s strongest in high-cost coastal areas and weaker inland, suggesting region-specific market dynamics.

Visualization Insights:
KDE maps effectively visualized housing value density, highlighting urban clustering and terrain-related constraints (e.g., mountainous or desert regions).

🏗️ Workflow
# Example R Workflow
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(spdep)
library(GWmodel)

# Load Data
housing <- read.csv("california_housing.csv")

# Convert to Spatial Object
housing_sf <- st_as_sf(housing, coords = c("longitude", "latitude"), crs = 4326)

# Moran’s I Test
nb <- poly2nb(housing_sf)
lw <- nb2listw(nb)
moran.test(housing_sf$median_house_value, lw)

# GWR Example
gwr_model <- gwr.basic(median_house_value ~ median_income + housing_median_age, data = housing_sf)

💡 Policy Implications

This study underscores that housing market inequalities in California are spatially structured, not random.
Understanding these patterns is crucial for:

Designing region-specific housing affordability policies,

Guiding urban growth and zoning decisions, and

Anticipating the impacts of climate change and gentrification on vulnerable inland communities.

🚀 Future Directions

Extend analysis to 2000 and 2020 census data to explore temporal evolution of housing inequity.

Incorporate climate risk variables (e.g., wildfire exposure, flood zones).

Use spatiotemporal models (e.g., Bayesian spatial regression, spatial panel models) for longitudinal trends.

Develop a web-based interactive map using R Shiny or Leaflet.
